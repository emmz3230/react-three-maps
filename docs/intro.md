# React-Three-Map

`React-Three-Map` is a bridge to use react-three-fiber inside react-map-gl.

Until now you had:

| imperative      | declarative (react) |
| --------------- | ------------------- |
| Maplibre/Mapbox | react-map-gl        |
| THREE.js        | react-three-fiber   |

Now with `react-three-map`, you can use them together 🤜⭐🤛.

```
    npm install react-three-map
```
